# DMA validation study

This repository contains code used to produce the analysies for a mixed-methods validation study of a data maturity assessment in healthcare settings. This repository contains the analysis for the quantitative part of the study in which structural validation was tested using both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. Additionally, chronbach alpha values were calculated for the new domains.
